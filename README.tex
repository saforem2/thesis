Application of the L2HMC algorithm to simulations in lattice QCD. A

\textbf{NOTE}: There are compatibility issues with
\texttt{tensorflow.\_\_version\_\_\ \textgreater{}\ 1.12} To be sure
everything runs correctly, make sure \texttt{tensorflow==1.12.x} is
installed.

Given an analytically described distributions (simple examples can be
found in \texttt{l2hmc-qcd/utils/distributions.py}), L2HMC enables
training of fast-mixing samplers.

\subsection{Modified implementation for Lattice Gauge Theory / Lattice
QCD
models.}\label{modified-implementation-for-lattice-gauge-theory-lattice-qcd-models.}}

This work is based on the original implementation which can be found at
\href{https://github.com/brain-research/l2hmc}{brain-research/l2hmc/}.

My current focus is on applying this algorithm to simulations in lattice
gauge theory and lattice QCD, in hopes of obtaining greater efficiency
compared to generic HMC.

This new implementation includes the algorithm as applied to the \(2D\)
\(U{(1)}\) lattice gauge theory model (i.e.~compact QED).

Additionally, this implementation includes a convolutional neural
network architecture that is prepended to the network described in the
original paper. The purpose of this additional structure is to better
incorporate information about the geometry of the lattice.

Lattice code can be found in \texttt{l2hmc-qcd/lattice/} and the
particular code for the \(2D\) \(U{(1)}\) lattice gauge model can be
found in \texttt{l2hmc-qcd/lattice/lattice.py}.

This model can be trained using distributed training through
\href{https://github.com/horovod/horovod}{\texttt{horovod}}, by passing
the \texttt{-\/-horovod} flag as a command line argument.

Example command line arguments can be found in \texttt{l2hmc-qcd/args}.
To run \texttt{l2hmc-qcd/gauge\_model\_main.py} using one of the
\texttt{.txt} files found in \texttt{l2hmc-qcd/args}, simply pass the
\texttt{*.txt} file as the only command line argument prepended with
\texttt{@}.

For example, from within the \texttt{l2hmc-qcd/args} directory:

\begin{verbatim}
python3 ../gauge_model_main.py @gauge_model_args.txt
\end{verbatim}

All of the relevant command line options are well documented and can be
found in \texttt{l2hmc-qcd/utils/parse\_args.py}. Almost all relevant
information about different parameters and run options can be found in
this file.

Model information can be found in
\texttt{l2hmc-qcd/models/gauge\_model.py} which is responsible for
building the graph and creating all the relevant tensorflow operations
for training and running the L2HMC sampler.

The code responsible for actually implementing the L2HMC algorithm is
dividied up between \texttt{l2hmc-qcd/dynamics/gauge\_dynamics.py} and
\texttt{l2hmc-qcd/network/}.

The code responsible for performing the augmented leapfrog algorithm is
implemented in the \texttt{GaugeDynamics} class defined in
\texttt{l2hmc-qcd/dynamics/gauge\_dynamics.py}.

There are multiple different neural network architectures defined in
\texttt{l2hmc-qcd/network/} and different architectures can be specified
as command line arguments defined in
\texttt{l2hmc-qcd/utils/parse\_args.py}.

\texttt{l2hmc-qcd/notebooks/} contains a random collection of jupyter
notebooks that each serve different purposes and should be somewhat self
explanatory.
